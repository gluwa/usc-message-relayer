//! Fan-out hub: one broadcast channel from the swarm task to every WebSocket client.
//!
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` gives fire-hose semantics for free: the swarm loop never blocks on a
//! slow consumer (send is non-blocking), and a subscriber that falls more than the channel
//! capacity behind observes `Lagged` — its connection handler disconnects it rather than serving
//! silently gappy data. Events are `Arc`ed so a burst fanned out to N clients clones pointers,
//! not JSON.
