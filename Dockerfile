# Cluster nodes are amd64 — from Apple Silicon, build and push with:
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t gluwa/usc-message-relayer:<git-sha> --push .
#
# BuildKit cache mounts persist the cargo registry + build artifacts across builds, so a code-only
# change rebuilds in minutes. The runtime stage keeps the binary at /bin/message-relayer and ships
# a shell, matching how the creditcoin-message-relayer Helm chart invokes it — the chart's
# /bin/sh wrapper substitutes mounted secrets into the config, then execs the binary.
#
# The runtime stage uses ubuntu:26.04 to match the CI runner OS (ubuntu-26.04); the
# check-image-sync CI job enforces that these stay aligned. Building on the older
# rust:1.96-bookworm (glibc 2.36) and running on ubuntu:26.04 (glibc 2.39) is the safe
# forward-compatible direction — an older build glibc links fine against a newer runtime glibc.

# Matches rust-toolchain.toml.
