//! Signer balance monitoring.
//!
//! Every tx-sending role runs off a plain EOA that only needs gas — delivery on the destination
//! chain, ack and claim submission on the Creditcoin chain. When one runs dry, its sends start
//! failing with whatever wording that node gives an underfunded sender, which is indistinguishable
//! at a glance from an RPC problem; nothing anywhere pointed at the wallet. Industry relayers
//! (Hyperlane's `hyperlane_wallet_balance`, OpenZeppelin Defender's balance monitors) treat signer
//! balance as a headline metric for exactly this reason.
//!
//! This worker polls each configured signer's balance every [`POLL_INTERVAL`] and publishes
//! `relayer_signer_balance_ether{chain_key, role, address}`, so a dashboard threshold
//! (`< 0.1` say) warns while there is still time to top up rather than when deliveries are
//! already failing.
