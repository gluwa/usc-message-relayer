//! Persistent per-watcher block cursors.
//!
//! Both the Outbox watcher (source chain `MessagePublished`) and the acknowledgment watcher
//! (destination chain `MessageDelivered`) scan chain logs by block range. Without persistence they
//! start from the chain head on every boot, so any event emitted while the relayer was down is
//! silently skipped. This store records the last block each watcher has fully processed and is
//! consulted on startup, so a restart resumes from `last_processed + 1` instead of the head — the
//! relayer never misses an on-chain event, even across downtime.
//!
//! Storage is a single JSON file written atomically (temp file + rename) so a crash mid-write
//! cannot corrupt it. Reprocessing the tail of a range after an unclean shutdown is safe:
//! delivery is idempotent (`MessageAlreadyValidated`) and acks are deduped + idempotent
//! (`MessageAlreadyAcknowledged`), so the cursor gives at-least-once, never at-most-once.
//!
//! Each entry is `{ "block": 1234, "outbox": "0x..." }` — `outbox` records which Outbox address
//! that block cursor was scanned against (Outbox watcher keys only; a bare block number can't
//! tell a valid checkpoint apart from one left over from a since-rotated-away Outbox, see
//! `events::watch_outbox`'s resume logic). Checkpoint files written before this field existed
//! store a bare number per key instead; both shapes deserialize, and any touched key is rewritten
//! in the current shape on its next save.
//!
//! Note: this covers durable *on-chain* events. Attestor votes travel over gossip (ephemeral) and
//! are out of scope here — a relayer that was down while votes were gossiped relies on the votes
//! being re-observed, not on this cursor.
