//! Vote pool — the heart of relayer aggregation logic.
//!
//! Receives [`IndexedMessage`]s from the outbox watcher and [`MessageVote`]s from the libp2p
//! worker, then enforces PoC §6.2 validation rules (chain-first allowlist, ecrecover, signer
//! allowlist, dedup) before counting. When a `messageHash` accumulates `>= threshold` distinct
//! signers, the pool builds a [`DeliveryJob`] and dispatches it to the per-route delivery
//! channel.
//!
//! The pool runs as a single tokio task. State is **not** shared with other tasks — workers
//! talk to it strictly through mpsc channels. This keeps locking trivial and makes RAM-bound
//! invariants (PoC §9) easy to reason about.
