//! Per-route on-chain attestor-set watcher.
//!
//! For routes whose attestor set is sourced on-chain (`AttestorSet::OnChain { Evm }`), this worker
//! periodically reads the destination validator's `attestors()` + `threshold()` and pushes a
//! [`RouteAttestors`] update to the vote pool whenever they change. That lets an operator
//! add/remove an attestor on the `EOAValidator` (or change the threshold) and have the relayer pick
//! it up **without a restart** — closing the "static set, resolved once" gap. Routes with a static
//! configured set don't run a watcher.
