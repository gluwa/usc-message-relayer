//! Solidity ABI bindings for the USC write-ability contracts.
//!
//! Shared by the attestor (which decodes `MessagePublished` from the Creditcoin Outbox) and the
//! `message-relayer` (which additionally calls `Inbox.deliverMessage` / `validateVotes`). Keeping
//! one definition here means both crates decode the *same* event signature and recompute the
//! *same* `messageHash` — a mismatch would make every signature verify as invalid on-chain.
//!
//! Inline `alloy::sol!` declarations are used while the production contracts are finalized — when
//! they ship, switch each block to the JSON form (`#[sol(rpc)] interface X, "contracts/x.json"`)
//! following the pattern in `common/eth/src/evm/block_prover.rs`. Keep the function & event
//! signatures byte-identical with the production artefacts.
